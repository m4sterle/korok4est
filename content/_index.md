# Welcome to the korok4est ğŸŒ±

*where clinical wisdom meets digital exploration... ya ha ha!*

This digital garden documents my journey at the intersection of medicine and technology - a space where clinical reasoning frameworks transform into code, where medical knowledge finds new expression through creative design, and where personal growth happens through integration rather than fragmentation.

Within these digital leaves, you'll discover the workings of Master Le, Inc. - a framework I've created to make sense of my multifaceted journey from medical student to clinical tech sage.
