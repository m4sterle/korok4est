# About this Forest

*or: how I accidentally built a digital ecosystem to make sense of everything*

## The Seed: When Knowledge Needed a Home

It all started with a simple problem: medical knowledge is ENORMOUS, and the traditional ways of organizing it weren't working for my brain. Linear notes felt disconnected from the interconnected reality of medicine. Flashcards were missing the "why" that makes information stick. Traditional textbooks couldn't capture the beautiful web of connections between symptoms, diseases, and treatments.

I needed a system that could think the way my brain thinks - in patterns, connections, and visual frameworks. Something that could show how a single symptom connects to multiple potential diagnoses, or how different body systems influence each other.

But I couldn't find that perfect system... so I started building it myself hehe.

## The Sprout: Discovery of Digital Gardens

The turning point came when I discovered the concept of **digital gardens** - these beautiful, interconnected knowledge systems where notes link together like neurons in a brain! ðŸ§ âœ¨ This wasn't just note-taking; it was knowledge cultivation - planting ideas, connecting them, and watching them grow over time.

When I first saw Obsidian's graph view displaying all these interconnected notes, something in my brain literally LIT UP. This was exactly how I visualized medical knowledge in my head! Not as isolated facts, but as this intricate, living network.

I realized I could create a system where:
- Symptoms could link to potential diagnoses
- Diseases could connect to pathophysiology
- Diagnostic approaches could link to clinical cases
- And everything could be visualized in ways that made intuitive sense!

## The Growth: From Med School to Tech Exploration

As my digital garden grew, something unexpected happened. The more I built these knowledge systems, the more I found myself drawn to the technical aspects of how knowledge could be organized, visualized, and shared.

I started learning about web development to better display my medical knowledge. I experimented with code to create interactive clinical reasoning tools. I explored AI to see how it could enhance diagnostic thinking.

Suddenly, I wasn't just a medical student using tech tools - I was actively exploring the intersection of medicine and technology as its own fascinating domain! ðŸ‘€

## The Bloom: Birth of Master Le, Inc.

As these interests evolved, I found myself feeling pulled in multiple directions. Part of me was still deeply passionate about clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis. Another part was excited about coding and technical implementation. And yet another part loved the creative aspects of designing these knowledge systems.

Rather than seeing these as competing interests fragmenting my focus, I realized they were complementary facets of a single integrated vision! And thus, Master Le, Inc. was born - with each "department" representing a different aspect of this vision:

- **Detective Le** became the keeper of clinical knowledge and reasoning frameworks
- **YOG1TRON** (named after my corgi Yogi!) became the technical implementer
- **Heart Le** became the creative designer bringing ideas to visual life
- **Master Le** became the integrating force connecting everything together

## Why "korok4est"?

The name "korok4est" is a playful nod to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where koroks are hidden throughout the world, waiting to be discovered with the rewarding "Ya ha ha!" when found.

This digital garden functions the same way - filled with hidden connections and discoveries that reveal themselves as you explore. Each note is like a korok seed, marking a moment of discovery or insight along the journey.

Just as Link collects korok seeds throughout his adventure, this space collects the seeds of knowledge and experience that mark my path from medicine to technology - creating something that's greater than the sum of its parts.

## What You'll Find Here

This space documents:
- **Detective Le's case files** - Clinical reasoning frameworks and medical knowledge
- **YOG1TRON's lab notes** - Technical experiments and coding adventures
- **Heart Le's design studio** - Visual systems and creative expressions
- **Memory anchors** - Emotional waypoints from the journey
- **Integration explorations** - How these different domains connect and enhance each other

Welcome to the korok4est! Ya ha ha! ðŸŒ±
