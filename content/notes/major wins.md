Alright, alright. If you just came here from the [[failure resume]], then UR IN LUCK! 🍀✨ We about to **rebut** those ‘mf losses with these ***wins***.

But uh, if the reverse is true for you… and you’re planning on heading over to that [[failure resume|sad, sad note]]… then sorry buddy but the opposite of luck is in store for you. 🤷‍♀️ Though… you probably deserve it—I mean, *brah…* you must be the type to pick to hear good news first, then bad news when presented with a decision on which to hear first if you went this route (which is obviously the wrong choice, idiot). 

**ANYWAYSSSS**, similar to the [[failure resume|legend of LOSERS]] write up, we have a whole squad contributing to the win’s of master le, inc. and here they be:

## detective le
1. discovered the [[game-of-clue|ddxCLUE game philosophy]]
2. navigated through a [[pillars case 11-2|chilling case of pheochromocytoma]] via said philosophy

## heart le 
3. created our beloved [[korok4est]]
4.
