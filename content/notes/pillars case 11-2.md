## wot is pillars ?
Pillar is this collaborative clinical case discussion that my school do for obvious reasons, lol. Initially, I hated these sessions, mainly because I dreaded waking up for an 8 AM class (YETH I KNOWWW)

## 🎲 the game setup
**The Mystery**: There's been a disturbance in the adrenal system! Six suspects (adrenal disorders) are under investigation, but only one is behind our patient's symptoms.


**The Suspects:**
- Professor Pheochromocytoma in the Medulla
- Colonel Conn's in the Cortex
- Dr. Paraganglioma in the Sympathetic Chain
- Lady Adenoma of the Adrenal Estate
- Major Myelolipoma from the Fatty Forces
- Captain Carcinoma of the Cortical Corps

## 🏰 The Game Board
Just as CLUE has different rooms where evidence can be found, our medical mystery takes place across different diagnostic spaces:

### Investigation Rooms:
1. **The Laboratory** - Where biochemical secrets are revealed
2. **The Radiology Chamber** - Home of imaging clues
3. **The Patient Encounter Room** - Where symptoms tell their tales
4. **The Research Facility** - Repository of epidemiology and etiology
5. **The Pathology Department** - Where microscopic evidence lies
