*where clinical wisdom meets digital exploration*

## Origin Story
[Your raw, honest content about the journey from the "about this forest" page - it's powerful and real!]

## The Plot Twist
[Keep that authentic voice from "Another About Page" - the Detective Le introduction is literally perfect]

## Current Quest Line
[This is where we add our new narrative - the Clinical Tech Sage arc!]

Hey there! You've wandered into a unique corner of the digital realm - a space where medical knowledge, technical exploration, and personal growth collide in sometimes chaotic but always interesting ways. I'm the curator of this forest (you might know me as Detective Le in some parts!), and this space has evolved alongside my journey from medical student to aspiring Clinical Tech Sage.

What started as a way to document medical school musings has grown into something more - a living laboratory where clinical reasoning meets code, where differential diagnoses meet digital exploration, and where personal challenges transform into growth opportunities.

### What You'll Find Here
* **DDX CLUE Series** - Where I break down clinical cases with probably too much enthusiasm
* **Tech Adventures** - Documentation of my coding journey (currently starring: The Legend of Python!)
* **Growth Chronicles** - Both victories and battle scars, because both shape the path
