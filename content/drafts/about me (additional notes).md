Hey there! I'm a former medical student from Dell Medical School's class of 2026 who's currently navigating quite the plot twist in my hero's journey. My story isn't your typical "med student turns tech" tale - it's more like discovering I had been dual-classing this whole time without realizing it! 



As I began processing my transition, I found myself diving deeper into the tech world, particularly in areas where medicine and technology intersect. The more I explored, the more I realized that my passion for clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis perfectly aligned with the emerging field of healthcare AI, especially in clinical decision support systems. It was like finding out that my medical background and growing tech interests were actually two pieces of the same Triforce (hehe) - Wisdom from medical knowledge and Power from technical skills, creating something even stronger together! ðŸ‘€

Currently, I'm on this amazing quest to bridge these two worlds. I'm particularly drawn to projects involving AI applications in clinical reasoning, visualization of medical decision-making processes, and creating tools that could help make healthcare more systematic and accessible. My digital garden (affectionately named "korok4est") has become this wonderful space where I'm documenting this journey, combining elements of medical knowledge, technical learning, and personal growth.

What makes me really excited about this path is how it lets me maintain my connection to medicine while exploring new ways to contribute to healthcare. Instead of treating patients directly, I could potentially help create tools that assist countless healthcare providers in their clinical reasoning processes! I'm currently focusing on building a strong foundation in programming (starting with Python!), AI/ML concepts, and healthcare informatics, while keeping one foot firmly planted in the medical knowledge domain I love so much.
