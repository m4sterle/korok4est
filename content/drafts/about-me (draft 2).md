## medical origins
You see, throughout my time in medical school, I found myself absolutely fascinated by clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis (like, seriously, NEJM clinical case articles got me bricked up). There was something admirable about the way physicians could take a complex set of symptoms and systematically work through possibilities to reach a diagnosisâ€”almost like a [[../notes/game-of-clue.md|badass game of clue]].

I would spend hours in self-made rabbit holes trying to understand the intricacies of clinical decision-making and I think this was the early beginnings of my [[../notes/medical-knowledge.md|early obsessions with organizing medical info]].

## plot twist 
During a challenging period that led to my withdrawal from medical school, I discovered something unexpected - my love for systematic thinking and visual documentation was actually pointing me toward a hidden skill tree! This revelation came through my digital garden project (hehe, I call it my "korok4est"), which accidentally became my gateway into the tech world, introducing me to things like web development, the fediverse, and even the Gemini protocol!

## The Current Quest Line
Currently, I'm on this amazing journey to bridge these two worlds. It's like discovering that my medical background and growing tech interests were actually two pieces of the same Triforce - Wisdom from medical knowledge and Power from technical skills, creating something even stronger together! 

I'm particularly drawn to:
* Clinical decision support systems (combining AI with human judgment!)
* Visual tools for medical education (like my DDX CLUE series hehe)
* Ways to make clinical reasoning more accessible and engaging
* AI applications that support (not replace!) medical decision-making

## The Character Build
I'm building this unique skillset through:
* The Legend of Python (my coding journey!)
* AI/ML adventures in healthcare
* Digital garden cultivation ðŸŒ±
* Project-based learning (check out my [[DDX-CLUE-series]]!)
