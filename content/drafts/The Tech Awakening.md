*or: how I accidentally became a Clinical Tech Sage*

## First Contact with AI
It started in the PCL Library, between memorizing gram-negative bacteria and trying to understand virulence factors. Brain mentions something about ChatGPT, and I'm like "oh neat" before diving back into my FOD exam prep. Little did I know that moment would be the first of many where technology would start sneaking into my medical world!

Looking back now, it's kind of funny how these tech tools kept appearing when I least expected them:
* First it was Notion (my gateway drug into digital organization hehe)
* Then Obsidian's graph view made me see medical knowledge in a whole new way
* Suddenly I'm diving into forums looking for other med students who GET IT
* And now here I am, building a whole digital garden! 

## The Obsidian Revelation
Remember that nursing student's graph view that literally made my neurons dance? That was the moment everything clicked. Medical knowledge isn't just linear lists - it's this beautiful, interconnected web of concepts! Just like how different body systems interact, our notes could too!

## Birth of the korok4est
So here's the thing about accidental tech journeys - they start with "oh, this is neat" and somehow end up with you creating an entire digital ecosystem with:
* Detective Le's case files (because why just study cases when you can SOLVE them?)
* Visual clinical reasoning maps
* A whole company of digital companions (feat. that legendary meat logo lol)

*Side note: Brain probably didn't expect his casual ChatGPT mention to lead to all THIS, but here we are!* ðŸ‘€
