*where medicine meets digital exploration... and maybe a few koroks*

## The Origin Quest
It all started with Notion (as these things often do ðŸ‘€). There I was, a medical student trying to organize the vast expanse of medical knowledge, when I fell down the most beautiful rabbit hole. You know that feeling when you discover something that makes your neurons literally dance? That was me finding Obsidian's graph view for the first time.

Picture this: I'm scrolling through endless OneNote notebooks (like everyone else in med school because hey, if it works, it works), when suddenly I stumble across this completely different way of visualizing medical knowledge. Not just linear notes, but this intricate web of connections that actually reflects how medicine works in real life! 

## The Tech Awakening
Let's be real - med students are creatures of habit (and with good reason... who has time to explore new apps when there's another anatomy exam tomorrow? ðŸ¥º). But there I was, diving deep into forums, searching desperately for other medical students who saw what I saw - that medicine isn't just about memorizing facts, it's about understanding connections.

When I found that nursing student's vault... *chef's kiss* That graph view! It was like seeing medicine the way my brain actually processes it - this beautiful, interconnected web of knowledge where everything influences everything else. Suddenly, differential diagnosis wasn't just a list; it was this living, breathing network of possibilities!

## Current Quest Line
Now I'm on this journey to combine it all - clinical reasoning, tech exploration, and personal growth. This forest isn't just a digital garden; it's a laboratory where medicine meets code, where differential diagnoses meet graph databases, and where maybe, just maybe, we can create something that helps others see these connections too.

### What You'll Find Here
* **Clinical Connections** - Medicine the way my brain sees it (spoiler: lots of graphs!)
* **Tech Experiments** - Because who says you can't mix medical knowledge with coding adventures?
* **Growth Chronicles** - Both the victories and the plot twists, because every good story has both
