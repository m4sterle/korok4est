Hey there! I'm a former medical student from Dell Medical School's class of 2026 who's currently navigating quite the plot twist in my hero's journey. My story isn't your typical "med student turns tech" tale - it's more like discovering I had been dual-classing this whole time without realizing it! 

You see, throughout my time in medical school, I found myself absolutely fascinated by clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis. There was something magical about the way physicians could take a complex set of symptoms and systematically work through possibilities to reach a diagnosis. But what really lit up my neural pathways was visualizing these thought processes! I would spend hours creating these intricate diagrams and flow charts, trying to capture the beautiful complexity of clinical decision-making. During a challenging period that led to my withdrawal from medical school, I discovered that this love for systematic thinking and visual documentation was actually pointing me toward an unexpected path.

As I began processing my transition, I found myself diving deeper into the tech world, particularly in areas where medicine and technology intersect. The more I explored, the more I realized that my passion for clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis perfectly aligned with the emerging field of healthcare AI, especially in clinical decision support systems. It was like finding out that my medical background and growing tech interests were actually two pieces of the same Triforce (hehe) - Wisdom from medical knowledge and Power from technical skills, creating something even stronger together! ðŸ‘€

Currently, I'm on this amazing quest to bridge these two worlds. I'm particularly drawn to projects involving AI applications in clinical reasoning, visualization of medical decision-making processes, and creating tools that could help make healthcare more systematic and accessible. My digital garden (affectionately named "korok4est") has become this wonderful space where I'm documenting this journey, combining elements of medical knowledge, technical learning, and personal growth.

What makes me really excited about this path is how it lets me maintain my connection to medicine while exploring new ways to contribute to healthcare. Instead of treating patients directly, I could potentially help create tools that assist countless healthcare providers in their clinical reasoning processes! I'm currently focusing on building a strong foundation in programming (starting with Python!), AI/ML concepts, and healthcare informatics, while keeping one foot firmly planted in the medical knowledge domain I love so much.

The best part? This journey feels less like leaving medicine behind and more like discovering a new way to pursue my original goal of improving healthcare - just with a different set of tools than I initially imagined. It's like finding an alternate quest route that actually fits my character build better! Now I'm working on building this unique combination of skills that could help bridge the gap between clinical thinking and technological innovation. And honestly? For the first time in a while, I'm really excited about where this path might lead! ðŸŒ±âœ¨
