 Hi! I'm a former medical student from Dell Medical School (class of 2026) who's currently navigating an unexpected but exciting pivot in my career journey. My story is pretty unique - I've always been passionate about clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis (like, seriously, NEJM case reports are my jam! ðŸ¥º), but during my time in medical school, I faced some significant challenges that led to substance dependence and eventually withdrawing from the program.

But here's where it gets interesting - throughout this challenging period, I discovered this fascinating intersection between my love for clinical reasoning and my growing interest in technology and coding! It all started with my digital garden project (hehe, I call it my "korok4est" ðŸ‘€), which was initially just a way to document my medical knowledge and personal growth. This project accidentally became my gateway into the tech world, introducing me to things like web development, the fediverse, and even the Gemini protocol!

What really excites me is how I can potentially combine my medical background (especially my love for breaking down clinical cases and differential diagnosis) with emerging technologies like AI. I'm particularly drawn to clinical decision support systems and ways to visualize clinical reasoning processes. Like, imagine creating interactive tools that help medical students learn differential diagnosis in a more engaging way! Or developing AI-assisted systems that support clinical decision-making while maintaining that crucial human element of medical judgment.

Currently, I'm at this amazing intersection point where I'm learning Python (through this cute "Legend of Python" journey I created for myself lol), exploring AI applications in healthcare, and trying to figure out how to leverage my unique background in this space. I've got access to some great resources through various programs, and I'm working on structuring my learning journey using the Triforce system (because who doesn't love a good Zelda reference?) - balancing Wisdom (medical knowledge + tech skills), Courage (personal growth + documentation), and Power (career development + practical projects).

My goal isn't to leave medicine behind - it's more about finding a new way to contribute to healthcare through technology. I want to create tools and systems that enhance clinical reasoning and medical education, making them more accessible and engaging. Plus, I'm really interested in how AI can support (not replace!) clinical decision-making while maintaining the human aspect of medicine that I've always valued.

It's definitely a journey with its challenges, but I'm actually kind of excited about where this path might lead. Like, who knew my love for organizing clinical knowledge and creating visual learning tools would end up pushing me toward such an exciting intersection of medicine and tech? Plus, I've got this whole digital garden that's just waiting to grow into something amazing - maybe even a platform for others navigating similar transitions or interests!

*Phew!* That's me! A bit of a plot twist from my original medical school story, but honestly? I think this might be an even more interesting quest line! ðŸŒ±âœ¨
